### 💡 Reflection (STAR Technique)

**Situation:**  
During group projects in my coursework, I consistently found myself assuming leadership roles but sometimes struggled with team dynamics when others didn't meet my pace or standards.

**Task:**  
I needed to understand why I approach teamwork this way and how to leverage my strengths while improving collaboration.

**Action:**  
After taking the 16Personalities test, I:  
- Analyzed my ENTJ-A profile in depth  
- Compared the results with real project experiences  
- Identified specific behaviors to adapt (like being more patient with process-oriented tasks)  
- Created an action plan to practice empathetic communication

**Result:**  
The assessment gave me valuable self-awareness. I now:  
- Consciously delegate tasks to trust teammates more  
- Balance my big-picture focus with appreciation for details  
- Use my natural leadership to motivate rather than pressure others  
- Better understand different working styles in teams  

This growth was evident in my recent music player project, where I successfully guided teammates while respecting their creative processes.
